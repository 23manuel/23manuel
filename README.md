👋🏾 Hey, I'm Manuel

A curious systems thinker-in-progress using data, code, and real-world grit to explore meaningful solutions — and stay underestimated on purpose.

---

### 🌍 What I'm About:
- Building clarity from complexity using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python (still learning)
- Learning in public by sharing small, evolving projects and experiments
- Exploring how data and automation can solve real African business problems
- Thinking long-term about scalable, tech-powered systems

---

### 🧪 Current Projects & Experiments:
- Kenya Elections Data Exploration *(in progress)*
- Sales & Inventory Logic Simulator  
- Feedback-to-Insight Visual Dashboard

> Most of what I build here is self-initiated — just a guy learning by doing and keeping it real.
